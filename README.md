**Investigating sense of agency in multi-agent action-effect causality perception**

By action-outcome causality learning people are able to gain a sense of agency which motivates people to take goal-directed actions. However, peopleâ€™ sensation of agency can be influenced by the multi-agent context where the causation between agents and outcome are complex. This study examine how people judge the sense of agency of themselves and others when presented with different contingencies of the outcome controlled by the individual and another agent. The results shows that people can learn action-outcome causation from action-effect causal perception in multi-agent context, gain sense of agency when they do have control on the outcome and learn the agency of other agent when other agent has the causal power on the outcome.


This study is a step forward to understand how individuals work and perceive sense of agency with an external agent, which may give a hint to further inquiry of computational modeling and analysis of brain activities in the development of agency.
